# Towards end-to-end likelihood-free inference with convolutional neural networks (Radev, Mertens, Voss, & Köthe)

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks for each of the three examples presented in the paper. There are two additional
folders named _img_ and _model\_checkpoints_ with the latter containing a pretrained network (trained_model.hdf5)

The datasets used for the training of the models can be downloaded from the following link:

There is one zip-file for each example, containing the training set and the test set. The Jupyter Notebooks assume 
you have the data in a folder named _data_ on the same level as the two folders _model\_checkpoints_ and _img_. 

Please make sure to unzip the content of the respective zip-file into the _data_ folder you created.
